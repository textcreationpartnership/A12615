         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Touching the commodities, beſides the generall report of <hi>Cabeça de Vaca</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour (who firſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled through a great part of the Inland of <hi>Florida,</hi> next adioyning vpon our <hi>Virginia) That</hi> Florida <hi>was the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt countrie of the world; and, that after hee had found clothes made of cotton wooll,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 35.</note> 
               <hi>he ſaw gold and ſiluer, and ſtones of great value:</hi> I referre you firſt to the rich mines of gold reported to be in the prouince of <hi>Yupaha,</hi> and deſcribed in the twelfth Chapter of this Treatiſe to come within our limits: And againe, to the copper hatchets found in <hi>Cutifachiqui,</hi> ſtanding vpon the Riuer of <hi>Santa Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22850:3"/> which were ſaid to haue a mixture of gold. It ſeemeth alſo that the laſt Chronicler of the Weſt Indies, <hi>Antonio de Herrera,</hi> ſpeaking of the foreſaid Riuer of <hi>Santa Helena,</hi> which ſtandeth in <hi>32.</hi> degrees and an halfe, alludeth to the prouince of <hi>Yupaha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Decad. 3 lib. 8. cap. 8.</note> in theſe words: <hi>Y el oro, y plata, que hallaron, no era de aquella tierra, ſino de 60. leguas, adentro al norte, de los pueblos dichos</hi> Otapales <hi>y</hi> Ola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatanos, <hi>adonde ſe intiende, que ay minas de oro, plata, y cobre.</hi> That is to ſay, That the gold and ſiluer which they found, was not of that countrie (of <hi>Santa Helena</hi>) but <hi>60.</hi> leagues diſtant toward the North, of the townes called <hi>Ota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pales</hi> and <hi>Olagatanos,</hi> where we vnderſtand that there are mines of gold, ſiluer, and copper. By which reckoning theſe rich mines are in the latitude of <hi>35.</hi> degrees and an halfe. I deſire you likewiſe to take knowledge of the famous golden prouince of <hi>Chiſca,</hi> ſtretching further to the North, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Cacique of <hi>Coſte</hi> gaue notice to <hi>Ferdinando de So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> in the towne of <hi>Chiaha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 15.</note> affirming, that there were mines of copper, and of another mettall of the ſame colour, ſaue that it was finer, and of a farre more perfect luſtre, and farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſight, and that they vſed it not ſo much, becauſe it was ſofter. And the ſelfeſame thing was before told the Gouernour in <hi>Cutifachiqui:</hi> who ſent two Chriſtians from <hi>Chiaha</hi> with certaine Indians which knew the countrie of <hi>Chiſca,</hi> and the language thereof, to view it, and to make report of that which they ſhould finde.<note place="margin">Chap. 23.</note> We likewiſe reade not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Gouernour ſet forward to ſeeke a prouince called <hi>Pacaha,</hi> which hee was informed to be neere vnto <hi>Chiſca,</hi> where the Indians told him, that there was gold. And in another place hee ſaith;<note place="margin">Chap. 24.</note> That from <hi>Pacaha</hi> hee ſent thirtie horſemen and fiftie footmen to the prouince of <hi>Caluça,</hi> to ſee if from thence he might trauell to <hi>Chiſca,</hi> where the Indians ſaid, there was a worke of gold and copper. So that here is
<pb facs="tcp:22850:3"/> foure times mention, and that in ſundrie places, of the rich and famous golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mines of <hi>Chiſca,</hi> and that they lie beyond the mountaines toward the North, ouer which they were not able to trauell for the roughnes thereof. But what neede I to ſtand vpon forren teſtimonies, ſince Maſter <hi>Thomas He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> a man of much iudgement in theſe cauſes, ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all, at your late ſolemne meeting at the houſe of the right honourable the Earle of Exeter, how to the Southweſt of our old fort in <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Indians often informed him, that there was a great melting of red mettall, reporting the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in working of the ſame. Beſides, our owne Indians haue lately reuealed either this or another rich mine of copper or gold in a towne called <hi>Ritanoe,</hi> neere certaine mountaines lying Weſt of <hi>Roanoac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another very gainfull commoditie is, the huge quantitie of excellent perles, and little babies and birds made of them, that were found in <hi>Cutifachiqui.</hi> The abundance whereof is reported to be ſuch,<note place="margin">Chap. 14.</note> that if they would haue ſearched diuers graues in townes thereabout, they might haue laded many of their horſes. Neither are the Turkie ſtones and cotton wooll found at <hi>Guaſco</hi> to be forgotten, nor paſſed ouer in ſilence.</p>
            <p>But that, which I make no ſmall account of, is, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Oxen, which, from the beginning of the <hi>16.</hi> to the end of the <hi>26.</hi> Chapter, are nine ſeuerall times made mention of, and that along from <hi>Chiaha, Coſte, Pacaha, Coligoa,</hi> and <hi>Tulla,</hi> ſtill toward the North, to wit, toward vs, there was ſuch ſtore of them, that they could keepe no corne for them: and that the Indians liued vpon their fleſh. The haire of theſe Oxen is likewiſe ſaid to be like a ſoft wooll, betweene the courſe and fine wooll of ſheepe: and that they vſe them for couerlets, becauſe they are very ſoft and woolled like ſheep: and not ſo onely, but they make bootes, ſhooes, targets, and other things neceſſarie of the ſame. Beſides the former bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb facs="tcp:22850:4"/> their young ones may be framed to the yoke, for carting and tillage of our ground. And I am in good hope, that ere it be long we ſhall haue notice of their being neerer vs, by that which I reade in the Italian relation of <hi>Cabeça de Vaca,</hi> the firſt finder of them; which writeth, <hi>That they ſpread themſelues within the countrie aboue foure hundred leagues.</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reouer, <hi>Vaſques de Coronado,</hi> and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, <hi>Antonio de Eſpejo</hi> (whoſe voiages are at large in my third volume) trauelled many leagues among theſe heards of Oxen, and found them from <hi>33.</hi> degrees ranging very farre to the North and Northeaſt.</p>
            <p>A fourth chiefe commoditie wee may account to be the great number of Mulberrie trees, apt to feede Silke-wormes to make ſilke: whereof there was ſuch plentie in many places, that, though they found ſome hempe in the countrie, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards made ropes of the barks of them for their brigandines, when they were to put to ſea for <hi>Noua Hiſpania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fifth is the excellent and perfect colours, as black, white, greene, yellow, and red, and the materials to dye withall, ſo often ſpoken of in this diſcourſe: among which I haue ſome hope to bring you to the knowledge of the rich graine of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonillio, ſo much eſteemed, and of ſo great price. I ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſeuerall ſorts of paſsing good grapes for Wine and Raiſons.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 31. &amp; 32</note>Neither is it the leaſt benefit, that they found ſalt made by the Indians at <hi>Cayas,</hi> and in two places of the prouince of <hi>Aguacay:</hi> the manner alſo how the Inhabitants make it, is very well worth the obſeruation.</p>
            <p>One of the chiefeſt of all the reſt may be the notice of the S uth Sea,<note place="margin">Chap. 31. &amp; 32</note> leading vs to <hi>Iapan</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> which I finde here twice to be ſpoken of. Whereof long ſince I haue written a diſcourſe, which I thinke not fit to be made ouer common.</p>
            <p>For cloſing vp this point, The diſtances of places, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb facs="tcp:22850:4"/> of the ſoiles, the ſituations of the regions, the diuerſities and goodneſſe of the fruits, the ſeuerall ſorts of beaſts, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of fowles, the difference betweene the Inhabitants of the mountaines and the plaines, and the riches of the Inland in compariſon of the Seacoaſt, are iudicially ſet downe in the concluſion of this booke, whereunto for mine owne eaſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre you.</p>
            <p>To come to the ſecond generall head, which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I propoſed, concerning the manners and diſpoſitions of the Inhabitants: among other things, I finde them here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be very eloquent and well ſpoken, as the ſhort Orations, interpreted by <hi>Iohn Ortiz,</hi> which liued twelue yeeres among them, make ſufficient proofe. And the author, which was a gentleman of <hi>Eluas</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> emploied in all the action, whoſe name is not ſet downe, ſpeaking of the Cacique of <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> ſaith, that aſwell this Cacique, as the others, and all thoſe which came to the Gouernour on their behalfe, deliuered their meſſage or ſpeech in ſo good order, that no Oratour could vtter the ſame more eloquently. But for all their faire and cunning ſpeeches, they are not ouermuch to be truſted: for they be the greateſt traitors of the world, as their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold moſt craftie contriued and bloody treaſons, here ſet down at large, doe euidently proue. They be alſo as vnconſtant as the wethercock, and moſt readie to take all occaſions of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to doe miſchiefe. They are great liars and diſſemblers; for which faults often times they had their deſerued pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And many times they gaue good teſtimonie of their great valour and reſolution. To handle them gently, while gentle courſes may be found to ſerue, it will be without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon the beſt: but if gentle poliſhing will not ſerue, then we ſhall not want hammerours and rough maſons enow, I meane our old ſoldiours trained vp in the Netherlands, to ſquare and prepare them to our Preachers hands.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22850:17"/> of <hi>Mocoço:</hi> and there he ſaw two Indians fiſhing; and becauſe they were in war with the people of <hi>Vcita,</hi> and their languages were different, and hee knew not the language of <hi>Mocoço,</hi> he was afraid, becauſe he could not tell them who hee was, nor how hee came thither, nor was able to anſwer any thing for himſelfe, that they would kill him, taking him for one of the Indians of <hi>Vcita,</hi> and before they eſpied him, he came to the place where they had laid their weapons: &amp; aſſoone as they ſaw him, they fled toward the towne, and although he willed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtay, becauſe he meant to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no hurt, yet they vnderſtood him not, and ran away as faſt as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they could. And aſſone as they came to the towne with great outcries, many Indians came forth againſt him, and began to compaſſe him to ſhoote at him: <hi>Iohn Ortiz</hi> ſeeing himſelfe in ſo great danger, ſheilded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with certaine trees, and began to ſhreeke out, and crie very loud, and to tell them that he was a Chriſtian, and that he was fled from <hi>Vcita,</hi> and was come to ſee and ſerue <hi>Mocoço</hi> his Lord. It pleaſed God that at that very inſtant there came thither an Indian that could ſpeake the language and vnderſtood him; and pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt; who told them what hee ſaid. Then ran from thence three or foure Indians to beare the newes to their Lord: who came foorth a quarter of a league from the towne to receiue him; and was very glad of him. He cauſed him preſently to ſweare according to the cuſtome of the Chriſtians, that hee would not run away from him to any other Lord: and promiſed him to entreate him very well; and that if at any time there came any Chriſtians into that countrie, he would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let him goe, and giue him leaue to goe to them: and likewiſe tooke his oth to performe the ſame according
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22850:17"/> to the Indian cuſtome. About three yeeres after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Indians, which were fiſhing at ſea two leagues from the towne, brought newes to <hi>Mocoço</hi>

So he dwelt with <hi>Mocoço</hi> nine yeeres, with ſmall hope of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Chriſtians. Aſſoone as our Gouernor arriued in <hi>Florida,</hi> it was knowne to <hi>Mocoço,</hi> &amp; ſtraightway he ſignified to <hi>Iohn Ortiz,</hi> that Chriſtians were lodged in the towne of <hi>Vcita:</hi> And he thought he had ieſted with him, as hee had done before, and told him, that by this time he had forgotten the Chriſtians, and thought of nothing elſe but to ſerue him. But he aſſured him that it was ſo, and gaue him licence to goe vnto them: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him, that if hee would not doe it, and if the Chriſtians ſhould goe their way, he ſhould not blame him, for hee had fulfilled that which he had promiſed him. The ioy of <hi>Iohn Ortiz</hi> was ſo great, that hee could not beleeue that it was true: notwithſtanding he gaue him thankes, and tooke his leaue of him: and <hi>Mocoço</hi> gaue him tenne or eleuen principall Indians to beare him companie: and as they went to the port where the Gouernour was, they met with <hi>Baltaſar de Gallègos,</hi> as I haue declared before. Aſſoone as he was come to the campe, the Gouernour commanded to giue him a ſute of apparrell, and very good armour, and a faire horſe; and enquired of him, whether hee had notice of any countrie, where there was any gold or ſiluer? He anſwered, No, becauſe he neuer went ten leagues compaſſe from the place where he dwelt: But that

Whereof the Gouernour receiued great contentment: and ſaid that he deſired no more then to finde victuals, that hee might goe into the maine land, for the land of <hi>Florida,</hi> was ſo large, that in one place or other there could not chuſe but bee ſome rich Countrie. The <hi>Cacique Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coço</hi> came to the Port to viſit the Gouernor, and made this ſpeech following.</p>
               <p>

The fauour which I hope for of your Lordſhip is, that you would hold mee for yours, and bethinke your ſelfe to command me any thing, wherein I may doe you ſeruice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gouernour anſwered him, That although in freeing and ſending him the Chriſtian, he had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his honour and promiſe, yet he thanked him, and

Then he commanded a ſhirt to be giuen him, and other things, wherewith the Cacique being verie well contented, tooke his leaue of him, and departed to his owne towne.</p>

He anſwered them that he held him not in priſon, but that hee would haue him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie him to <hi>Vzachil.</hi> The Gouernour had notice by <hi>Iohn Ortiz,</hi> that an Indian told him how they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to gather themſelues together, and come vpon him, and giue him battell, and take away the Cacique from him. The day that it was agreed vpon, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour commanded his men to bee in a readines, and that the horſemen ſhould bee readie armed and on horſebacke euery one in his lodging, becauſe the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might not ſee them, and ſo more confidently come to the towne. There came foure hundred Indians in ſight of the campe with their bowes and arrowes, and placed themſelues in a wood, and ſent two Indians to bid the Gouernour to deliuer them the Cacique. The

There were 30. or 40. Indians ſlaine. The reſt fled to two very great lakes,<note place="margin">Two very great lakes.</note> that were ſomewhat diſtant the one from the other: There they were ſwimming, and the Chriſtians round about them. The calieuermen and croſſebowmen ſhot at them from the banke; but the diſtance being great, and ſhooting afarre off, they did them no hurt. The Gouernour commanded that the ſame night they ſhould compaſſe one of the lakes, becauſe they were ſo great, that there were not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enow to compaſſe them both: being beſet, aſſoone as night ſhut in, the Indians, with determination to runne away, came ſwimming very ſoftly to the banke; and to hide themſelues, they put a water lillie leafe on their heads. The horſemen aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as they perceiued it to ſtirre, ran into the water to the horſes breaſts, and the Indians fled againe into the lake.

And the Indians of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſsi,</hi> which were now looſed out of chaines, went ſwimming to them, and pulled them out by the haire of their heads, and they were all put in chaines; and the next day were diuided among the Chriſtians for their ſeruice.

It was a thing ſo ſtrange, and cauſed ſuch feare and terrour in our mindes, that it was not in our power to ſtay and receiue your Lordſhip with the ſolemnitie due to ſo high and renowned a Prince, as your Lordſhip is. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in your greatneſſe and ſingular vertues, I doe not onely hope to be freed from blame, but alſo to receiue fauours: and the firſt which I demand of your Lordſhip is, that you will vſe me, my Countrie, and ſubiects as your owne: and the ſecond, that you will tell mee who you are, and whence you come, and whither you goe, and what you ſeeke, that I the better may ſerue you therein.</hi>

The Indians want no fleſhmeat: for they kill with their arrowes many deere, hennes, conies, and other wild fowle: for they are very cunning at it: which skill the Chriſtians had not: and though they had it, they had no leaſure to vſe it: for the moſt of the time they ſpent in trauell, and durſt not preſume to ſtraggle aſide.

The next day there were ſundrie opinions deliuered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhould goe backe, or what they ſhould doe: and becauſe backward the Countrie whereby they had paſſed was greatly ſpoiled and deſtitute of Maiz, and that which they brought with them was ſpent, and the men were very weake, and the horſes likewiſe, they doubted much whether they might come to any place where they might helpe themſelues. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they were of opinion, that going in that ſort out of order, that any Indians would preſume to ſet vpon them, ſo that with hunger, or with warre, they could not eſcape.

The Gouernour, ſince his intent was to ſeeke another treaſure, like that of <hi>Atabalipa</hi> Lord of <hi>Peru,</hi> was not contented with a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, nor with pearles, though many of them were worth their weight in gold. And if the Countrie had been diuided among the Chriſtians, thoſe which the Indians had fiſhed for afterward, would haue been of more value: for thoſe which they had, becauſe they burned them in the fire, did leeſe their colour. The
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22850:32"/> Gouernour anſwered them, that vrged him to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, That in all the Countrie, there were not victuals to ſuſtaine his men one moneth; and that it was needfull to reſort to the Port of <hi>Ocus,</hi> where <hi>Maldanado</hi> was to ſtay for them: and that if no richer Countrie were found, they might returne againe to that whenſoeuer they would: and in the meane time the Indians would ſow their fields, and it would be better furniſhed with Maiz. He inquired of the Indians, whether they had notice of any great Lord farther into the land. They told him, that 12. daies iournie from thence,<note place="margin">Chiaha 12. daies iournie from Santa Helena: and Coſte 7. daies iournie from Chiaha: at which towne of Coſte, they had an oxe hide: Chap. 16.</note> there was a Prouince called <hi>Chiaha,</hi> ſubiect to the Lord of <hi>Coça.</hi> Preſently the Gouernour determined to ſeeke that land.

And though it ſeemed an errour to leaue that Countrie, (for others might haue been ſought round about, where the people might haue been ſuſtained, vntill the harueſt had been readie there, and the Maiz gathered) yet there was none that would ſay any thing againſt him, after they knew his reſolution.</p>

               <p>THe Gouernour departed from <hi>Cutifa Chiqui</hi> the third day of May. And becauſe the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had reuolted, and the will of the Ladie was perceiued, that if ſhe could, ſhe would depart without
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22850:33"/> giuing any guides or men for burdens, for the wrongs which the Chriſtians had done to the Indians: (for there neuer want ſome among many of a baſe ſort, that for a little gaine doe put themſelues and others in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of vndoing.) The Gouernour commanded her to be kept in ſafegard, and carried with him, not with ſo good vſage as ſhe deſerued for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good wil ſhe ſhewed, and good entertainement that ſhe had made him. And he verified that old prouerb which ſaith; For weldoing I receiue euill. And ſo he carried her on foot with his bondwomen to looke vnto her. In all the townes where the Gouernour paſſed, the Ladie commanded the Indians to come and carrie the burdens from one towne to another. We paſſed through her Countrie an hundred leagues, in which, as we ſaw, ſhe was much obeyed. For the Indians did all that ſhe commanded them with great efficacie and diligence. <hi>Peter</hi> the youth that was our guide, ſaid, that ſhe was not the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die her ſelfe, but a neece of hers, which came to that towne to execute certaine principal men by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Ladie, which had withheld her tribute: which words were not beleeued, becauſe of the lies which they had found in him before: but they bare with all things, becauſe of the need which they had of him, to declare what the Indians ſaid.

She carried away with her a little cheſt made of canes in manner of a coffer, which they call Petaca, full of vnbored perles. Some which could iudge of them, ſaid, that they were of great value.

The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour not to diſcontent her altogether, left them with her, making account that in <hi>Guaxule</hi> he would ask them of her, when he gaue her leaue to returne: which coffer ſhe carried away, and went to <hi>Xualla</hi> with three ſlaues which fled from the Campe, and one horſeman which remained behind, who falling ſicke of an ague went out of the way, and was loſt.

                  <hi>Mightie and excellent Lord, I hold my ſelfe for ſo happie a man, in that it hath pleaſed your Lordſhip to vſe me, that nothing could haue happened vnto me of more contentment, nor that I would haue eſteemed ſo much. From</hi> Guaxule <hi>your Lordſhip ſent vnto me, that I ſhould prepare Maiz for you in this towne for two moneths: Here I haue for you</hi> 20. <hi>barnes full of the choiſeſt that in all the Countrie could be found.

               <p>The Gouernor anſwered him, that he thanked him very much for his ſeruice and offer, and that he would alwaies account him as his brother. There was in this towne much butter in gourds melted like oile: they ſaid it was the fat of beares.<note place="margin">The fat of beares.</note> There was found alſo great ſtore of oile of walnuts,<note place="margin">Oile of Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts.</note> which was cleare as but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of a good taſte, and a pot full of honie of bees,<note place="margin">Honie of Bees.</note> which neither before nor afterward was ſeene in all the Countrie. The towne was in an Iſland<note place="margin">Chiaha ſeated in an Iſland.</note> betweene two armes of a Riuer, and was ſeated nigh one of them. The Riuer diuideth it ſelfe into thoſe two branches two croſſebow ſhot aboue the towne, and meeteth againe a league beneath the ſame. The plaine betweene both the branches is ſometimes one croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow ſhot, ſometimes two croſſebow ſhot ouer. The branches are very broad, and both of them may be waded ouer. There were all along them verie good meadows, and manie fields ſowne with Maiz. And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22850:35"/> becauſe the Indians ſtaied in their towne, the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour only lodged in the houſes of the Cacique, and his people in the fields; where there was euer a tree, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one tooke one for himſelfe. Thus the Camp lay ſeparated one from another, and out of order. The Gouernour winked at it, becauſe the Indians were in peace, and becauſe it was very hot, and the people ſhould haue ſuffered great extremitie, if it had not bin ſo. The horſes came thither ſo weake, that for feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they were not able to carrie their maſters: becauſe that from <hi>Cutifa-chiqui,</hi> they alwaies trauelled with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie little prouender, and were hunger-ſtarued and tired euer ſince they came from the deſert of <hi>Ocute.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The deſert of Ocute, chap. 14.</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt of them were not in caſe to vſe in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, though need ſhould require, they ſent them to feed in the night a quarter of a league from the Camp. The Chriſtians were there in great danger, becauſe that if at this time the Indians had ſet vpon them, they had been in euill caſe to haue defended themſelues. The Gouernour reſted there thirtie daies,<note place="margin">30. Daies reſt.</note> in which time, becauſe the Countrie was very fruitfull, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes grew fat. At the time of his departure, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of ſome, which would haue more then was reaſon, hee demanded of the Cacique 30. women to make ſlaues of. Hee anſwered that he would conferre with his chiefe men. And before hee returned an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, one night all of them with their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren forſooke the towne, and fled away. The next day the Gouernour purpoſing to goe to ſeeke them, the Cacique came vnto him, and at his comming vſed theſe words vnto the Gouernour:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mightie Lord, with ſhame and feare of your Lordſhip, becauſe my ſubiects againſt my will haue done amiſſe in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22850:35"/> themſelues, I went my way without your licenſe; and knowing the errour which I haue committed, like a loyall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, I come to yeeld my ſelfe into your power, to diſpoſe of mee at your owne pleaſure. For my ſubiects do not obey mee, nor doe any thing but what an Vncle of mine commandeth, which gouerneth this Countrie for me, vntill I be of a perfect age. If your Lordſhip will purſue them, and execute on them that, which for their diſobedience they deſerue, I will be your guide, ſince at this preſent my fortune will not ſuffer me to performe any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Preſently the Gouernour with 30. horſemen, and as many footemen, went to ſeeke the Indians,<note place="margin">Certaine townes.</note> and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by ſome townes of the principall Indians which had abſented themſelues, hee cut and deſtroyed great fields of Maiz; and went vp the Riuer, where the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were in an Iſland, where the horſemen could not come at them. There he ſent them word by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to returne to their towne and feare nothing, and that they ſhould giue him men to carrie burdens, as al thoſe behind had done; for he would haue no Indian women, ſeeing they were ſo loth to part with them. The Indians accepted his requeſt, and came to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour to excuſe themſelues; and ſo all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their towne. A Cacique of a Prouince cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eld <hi>Coste,</hi> came to this towne to viſit the Gouernour.

I receiue as much pleaſure and contentment with your ſight, as if you were my brother whom I dearely loued: vpon this point it is not needfull to vſe many reaſons; ſince it is no diſcretion to ſpeake that in many wordes, which in few may be vttered. How much the greater the will is, ſo much more giueth it name to the workes, and the workes giue teſtimonie of the truth. Now touching my will, by it you ſhall know, how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain &amp; manifeſt it is, and how pure inclination I haue to ſerue you.

And the Indians without any reſiſtance came and ſet the towne on fire; and taried without behind the doores for the Chriſtians, which ran out of the houſes, not hauing any leaſure to arme themſelues; and as they ran hither and thither amazed with the noiſe, and blinded with the ſmoke &amp; flame of the fire, they knew not which way they went, neither could they light vpon their weapons, nor ſaddle their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, neither ſaw they the Indians that ſhot at them.

The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour only rod on horſebacke, and with him a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier called <hi>Tapia,</hi> and ſet vpon the Indians, and ſtriking the firſt he met with his lance, the ſaddle fell with him,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:22850:47"/> which with haſte was euill girded, and ſo hee fell from his horſe. And all the people that were on foote were fled to a wood out of the towne, and there aſſembled themſelues together.

The towne lay all burnt to aſhes. There was a woman bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who, after ſhee and her husband were both gone out of their houſe, went in againe for certaine perles, which they had forgotten, and when ſhe would haue come out, the fire was ſo great at the doore that ſhee could not, neither could her husband ſuccour her. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three Chriſtians came out of their lodgings ſo cruelly burned, that one of them died within three daies, and the other two were carried many daies each of them vpon a couch betweene ſtaues, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians carried on their ſhoulders, for otherwiſe they could not trauell.

And <hi>Iohn Dannuſco</hi> the Auditor went with fifteene horſemen, and 40. footemen that way that the Gouernour was to goe, and found a ſtrong fort made, where the Indians ſtaied for him, and many of them walked on the top of it with their weapons, hauing their bodies, thighes and armes okered and died with blacke, white, yellow and red, ſtriped like vnto panes,<note place="margin">Blacke, white, yellow and red colours.</note> ſo that they ſhewed as though they went in hoſe and doublets: and ſome of them had plumes, and others had hornes on their heads, and their faces blacke, and their eies done round about with ſtrakes of red, to ſeeme more fierce. Aſſoone as they ſaw that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians approched, with a great crie ſounding two drummes with great furie they ſallied foorth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them. <hi>Iohn Dannuſco</hi> and thoſe that were with him, thought good to auoid them, and to acquaint the Gouernour therewith.

Three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were ſlaine there, and many Chriſtians were hurt, whereof within few daies, there died fifteene by the way.

There came an Indian very well accompanied with many Indians, ſaying, that hee was the Cacique. He deliuered him ouer to the men of his guard to look vnto him.

The Gouernour asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would bring him where the Cacique was? he ſaid, he would. And he went preſently to ſeeke him with twentie horſemen, and fiftie footemen: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſought him a day, and an halfe, hee found him in a ſtrong wood: And a ſouldiour not knowing him, gaue him a wound on the head; and he cried out, that he ſhould not kill him, ſaying, that he was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cique: ſo he was taken, &amp; an hundred and fortie of his men with him.

And while our men purſued ſome, others ſet vpon them another way. Thus the skirmiſh laſted ſo long, that the horſes were tired, and they could not make them runne.

The Gouernour ſent <hi>Iohn de Guzman,</hi> which had been a Captaine of footemen in <hi>Florida,</hi> with 15. armed men in canoes to make them giue way. Aſſoone as the Indians ſaw them come towards them, they diuided themſelues into two parts, and ſtood ſtill till the Spaniards came nie them, and when they were come neere them, they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together on both ſides, taking <hi>Iohn de Guzman</hi> in the middeſt, and them that came firſt with him, and with great furie borded them: And as their canoes were bigger, and many of them leaped into the water to ſtay them, and to lay hold on the canoes of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and ouerwhelme them; ſo preſently they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them.

And the other that came in canoes with their arrowes ſtaied for them that came againſt them, and at their comming both thoſe that were on land, and thoſe in the canoes wounded ſome of vs: And ſeeing vs come neere them, they turned their backs, and like ſwift horſes among footemen gat away from vs; making ſome returnes, and reuniting themſelues together, going not paſt a bow ſhot off: for in ſo retiring they ſhot, without receiuing any hurt of the Chriſtians. For though they had ſome bowes, yet they could not vſe them; and brake their armes with rowing to ouertake them. And the Indians eaſily in their compaſſe went with their canoes, ſtaying and wheeling about as it had been in a skirmiſh, perceiuing that thoſe that came againſt them could not offend them. And the more they ſtroue to come neere them, the more hurt they receiued. Aſſoone as they had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them farther off, they returned to the brigandines. They ſtaied two daies there: And departed from thence vnto the place, where the arme of the Riuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the ſea. They ſounded in the Riuer neere vnto the Sea, and found 40. fathoms water. They
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:22850:87"/> ſtaied there. And the Gouernour commanded al and ſingular perſons to ſpeake their minds touching their voiage, whether it were beſt to croſſe ouer to <hi>Nueua Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panna,</hi> committing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the hie ſea, or whether they ſhould keepe along the coaſt. There were ſundry opinions touching this matter: wherein <hi>Iohn Danuſco,</hi> which preſumed much, and tooke much vpon him in the knowledge of nauigation, and matters of the ſea, although hee had but little experience, mooued the Gouernour with his talke: and his opinion was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by ſome others. And they affirmed, that it was much better to paſſe by the hie ſea, and croſſe the gulfe, which was three of foure parts the leſſer trauell, becauſe in going along y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coaſt, they went a great way about, by reaſon of the compaſſe, which the land did make. <hi>Iohn Danuſco</hi> ſaid, that he had ſeene the ſeacard, and that from the place where they were, the coaſt ran Eaſt and Weſt vnto <hi>Rio de las Palmas;</hi> and from <hi>Rio de las Palmas</hi> to <hi>Nueua Eſpanna</hi> from North to South: and therefore in ſailing alwaies in ſight of land would bee a great compaſſing about and ſpending of much time; &amp; that they would be in great danger to be ouertaken with winter before they ſhould get to the land of the Chriſtians: and that in 10. or 12. daies ſpace, hauing good weather, they might bee there in croſſing ouer. The moſt part were againſt this opinion, and ſaid, that it was more ſafe to go along the coaſt, though they ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the longer: becauſe their ſhips were very weake and without decks, ſo that a very little ſtorme was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to caſt them away: and if they ſhould be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with calmes, or contrarie weather, through the ſmall ſtore of veſſels which they had to carrie water in, they ſhould likewiſe fall into great danger: and that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:22850:87"/> although the ſhips were ſuch as they might venture in them, yet hauing neither Pilot nor Seacard to guide themſelues, it was no good counſell to croſſe the gulfe. This opinion was confirmed by the greateſt part: and they agreed to go along the coaſt. At the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſought to depart from thence, the cable of the anker of the Gouernours brigandine brake, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker remained in the Riuer. And albeit, they were neere the ſhore, yet it was ſo deepe, that the Diuers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many times could neuer find it: which cauſed great ſadnes in the Gouernour, and in all thoſe that went with him in his brigandine: But with a grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone which they had, and certaine bridles which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to ſome of the Gentlemen, and men of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which had horſes, they made a weight which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſtead of an anker.

And ſeeing that they were gone two or three leagues from the ſhore, the Captaines of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brigandines ouertooke them, and asked the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, wherefore he did put off from the ſhore? and that if he would leaue the coaſt, he ſhould ſay ſo; and he ſhould not do it without the conſent of all: and that if hee did otherwiſe, they would not follow him, but that euery one would doe what ſeemed beſt vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

Which was to be beleeued. For the victuals, which the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doe pay them for tribute, are more then they can ſpend: and in that towne is no commerce; and there
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:22850:92"/> dwelt but few Spaniards there, and they were glad of their companie. The Alcalde Mayor diuided all the Emperours clothes which he had (which there they pay him for his tribute) among thoſe that would come to receiue them. Thoſe which had ſhirts of maile leſt, were glad men: for they had a horſe for one ſhirt of maile: Some horſed themſelues: and ſuch as could not (which were the greateſt part) tooke their iournie on foote: in which they were well receiued of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians that were in the townes, and better ſerued, then they could haue been in their owne houſes, though they had been well to liue. For if they asked one hen of an Indian, they brought them foure: and if they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked any of the Countrie fruit, though it were a league off, they ran preſently for it. And if any Chriſtian found himſelf euill at eaſe,<note place="margin">This is the manner of China, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie men in chaires.</note> they carried him in a chaire from one towne to another. In whatſoeuer towne they came, the Cacique, by an Indian which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a rod of Iuſtice in his hand, whom they call Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile, that is to ſay, a ſergeant, commanded them to prouide victuals for them, and Indians to beare bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of ſuch things as they had, and ſuch as were needfull to carrie them that were ſicke. The Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy ſent a Portugall 20. leagues from <hi>Mexico,</hi> with great ſtore of ſugar, raiſons of the Sunne, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues, and other things fit for ſicke folkes, for ſuch as had neede of them: and had giuen order to cloth them all at the Emperours charges. And their approch being knowne by the citizens of <hi>Mexico,</hi> they went out of the towne to receiue them: and with great courteſie, requeſting them in fauour to come to their houſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one carried ſuch as hee met home with him, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:22850:93"/> clothed them euery one the beſt they could: ſo that he which had the meaneſt apparrell, it coſt aboue 30. ducats. As many as were willing to come to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royes houſe he commanded to be apparelled, and ſuch as were perſons of qualitie ſate at his table: and there was a table in his houſe for as many of the meaner ſort as would come to it: and he was preſently informed, who euery one was, to ſhew him the courteſie that he deſerued. Some of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querors did ſet both gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and clownes at their owne table, and many times made the ſeruant ſit cheeke by cheeke by his maſter: and chiefly the officers and men of baſe condition did ſo: for thoſe which had better education did enquire who euery one was, and made difference of perſons: but all did what they could with a good will: and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one told them whom they had in their houſes, that they ſhould not trouble themſelues, nor thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the worſe, to take that which they gaue them: for they had bin in the like caſe, and had bin relieued of others, and that this was the cuſtome of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. God reward them all: and God grant, that thoſe which it pleaſed him to deliuer out of <hi>Florida,</hi> and to bring againe into Chriſtendome, may ſerue him: and vnto thoſe that died in that countrey, and vnto all that beleeue in him and confeſſe his holy faith, God for his mercie ſake grant the kingdome of heauen. Amen.</p>
